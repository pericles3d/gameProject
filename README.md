User stories:
This is an endless runner type game. Players can challenge each othe to see who goes further without crashing.
Obstacles are randomly generated, while the "tunnel" on which the character is travelling gets narrower as you advance.
I intend to have a top 10 scoreboard at the end and while the character flies through one of the "records" there will be a semi transparent line indicating he/she has gone into a record spot.
I expect many challenges to create this game as it will require some random obstacle generation and also a little bit of math to work the physics of gravity, etc.
I've done some research online and already found some nice info and help, so I am confident that I can get this game working and fun to play.
I also intend to get two or three different drawings for the character. On click the drawing will change. Maybe on crash it changes again.
If I have time, I will add some type of power-up which will make the obstacles shrink for a certain amount of time.

Start screen: There will be a logo and the option to choose One or Two players.
If One player is chosen you can play as many times as you want.
If 2 player mode is chosen you have the option to choose how many attempts each player has. 5, 10 or custom.
The colors of the character and obstacles will change for player 2, to better indicate whose turn it is.
At the end, the player who reached the furthest distance will win.

Gameplay:
Ready, Set, Go! will display and game starts as soon as the player clicks for the first time.
This is a single button game. Your character constantly move down with gravity and you click and hold to make him move up. (Probably mouse click and/or space bar will work)
If player hits the ceiling or ground, it crashes and game ends.
If player hits one of the obstacles, it also crashes and game ends.
As the game progresses, a counter on the top right screen keeps track of the distance you are travelling.
As you pass a top 10 record there will be markers showing that you reached a record spot.

Ending:
When a player crashes, the score (distance ran) will be displayed and if you got a record spot you will get a prompt to input your name.
Clicking on the end screen will take you to the start position and game restarts.

More details and goals:
I plan to have the game working as plain as possible to start. Very little attention will be paid to beauty in the early stages. This will be a lot more about getting the game to work and be fun to play. After this is accomplished I can make it look nice.

To Do:
- Start to think of graphics for the character and obstacles.
- Sound?
- Intro screen design.
